Developer notes: 

The Sales page and the language features as proposed in the wireframes design document have been omitted. This is due to time 
constraints. The sales page and language option were low priority and so, have been left out of this current build. 

Instructions:

User Clear Storage link in footer to logout and empty the shopping cart.
